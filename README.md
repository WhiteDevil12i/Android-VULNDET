# Android-VULNDET

## Abstract
The widespread adoption of the Android operating system in mobile devices has made it an
attractive target for cyber attackers. As the Android ecosystem continues to grow, the need for robust
prevention and detection mechanisms to safeguard against potential vulnerabilities becomes increasingly
paramount. In this research paper, we present a comprehensive approach to address the critical issue of
vulnerability exploitation in Android platform. The study commences with an in-depth analysis of the Android
platform using the Metasploit framework, simulating real-world attack scenarios to identify potential weak
points. By exposing these vulnerabilities, the work gains valuable insights into the techniques employed by
malicious actors to exploit Android platform weaknesses. Subsequently, this project delves into the
development of an effective prevention strategy to fortify the Android platform against potential threats. The
proposed technique provides a multi-layered defense mechanism, encompassing secure coding practices,
permission management, and enhanced access controls, aimed at bolstering the overall resilience of the system.
The work demonstrates this process by exploiting the Android platform using a malicious script created via
msfvenom, log captures while executing script and analysis gives a decision about genuine or malicious
application using LOG ANALYSIS script. This work also aims to prevent malicious code activities in Android
platform by using proposed security rules.
